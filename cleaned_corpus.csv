"How to reduce an image size in image processing (scipy/numpy/python) <p>Hello I have an image ( 1024 x 1024) and I used ""fromfile"" command in numpy to put every pixel of that image into a matrix.</p>

<p>How can I reduce the size of the image ( ex. to 512 x 512) by modify that matrix a?</p>

<pre><code>a = numpy.fromfile(( - path - ,'uint8').reshape((1024,1024))
</code></pre>

<p>I have no idea how to modify the matrix a to reduce the size of the image. So if somebody has any idea, please share your knowledge and I will be appreciated. Thanks</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>When I look at the result, I found that the reader I got read the image and put it into a ""matrix"". So I changed the ""array"" to matrix.</p>

<p>Jose told me I can take only even column and even row and put it into a new matrix . That will reduce the image to half size. What command in scipy/numpy do I need to use to do that? </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

"Strategies for replacing legacy data layer with Entity framework and POCO classes <p>We are using .net C# 4.0, VS 2010, EF 4.1 and legacy code in this project we are working on.</p>

<p>I'm working on a win form project where I have made a decision to start using entity framework 4.1 for accessing an ms sql db. The code base is quite old and we have an existing data layer that uses data adapters. These data adapters are used all over the place (in web apps and win form apps) My plan is to replace the old db access code with EF over time and get rid for the tight coupling between UI layers and data layer.</p>

<p>So my idea is to more or less combine EF with the legacy data access layer and slowly replace the legacy data layer with a more modern take on things using EF. So for now we need to use both EF and the legacy db access code.</p>

<p>What I have done so far is to add a project containing the edmx file and context. The edmx is generated using database first approach. I have also added another project that contains the POCO classes (by using ADO.NET POCO Entity Generator). I have more or less followed Julia Lerman's approach in her book ""Programming Entity Framework"" on how to split the model and the generated POCO classes. The database model has been set for years and it's not an option the change the table and the relationships, triggers, stored procedures, etc, so I'm basically stuck with the db model as it is. </p>

<p>I have read about the repository pattern and unit of work and I kind of like the patterns, but I struggle to implement them when I have both EF and the legacy db access code to deal with. Specially when I don't have the time to replace all of the legacy db access code with a pure EF implementation. In an perfect world I would start all over again with a fresh take one the data model, but that is not an option here.</p>

<p>Is the repository and unit of work patterns the way to go here? In order to use the POCO classes in my business layer, I sometimes need to use both EF and the legacy db code to populate my POCO classes. In another words, I can sometimes use EF to retrieve a part of the data I need and the use the old db access layer to retrieve the rest of the data and then map the data to my POCO classes. When I want to update some data I need to pick data from the POCO classes and use the legacy data access code to store the data in the database. So I need to map the data retrieved from the legacy data access layer to my POCO classes when I want to display the data in the UI and vice versa when I want to save data to the data base.</p>

<p>To complicate things we store some data in tables that we don't know the name of before runtime (Please don't ask me why:-) ). So in the old db access layer, we had to create sql statements on the fly where we inserted the table and column names based on information from other tables.</p>

<p>I also find that the relationships between the POCO classes are somewhat too data base centric. In another words, I feel that I need to have a more simplified domain model to work with. Perhaps I should create a domain model that fits the bill and then use the POCO classes as ""DAO's"" to populate the domain model classes?</p>

<p>How would you implement this using the Repository pattern and Unit of Work pattern? (if that is the way to go)</p>

"Python vs Lua for embedded scripting/text processing engine <p>For a project I'm currently working on, I'm looking to embed a scripting engine into my C++ code to allow for some extensibility down the line.  The application will require a fair amount of text processing and the use of regular expressions within these scripts.</p>

<p>I know Lua is generally the industry darling when it comes to embedded scripting, but I also know it doesn't support regular expressions (at least out of the box).  This is causing me to lean toward python for my language to embed, as it seems to have the best support behind Lua and still offers powerful regex capabilities.</p>

<p>Through a few screenshots that I have been able to grab, it appears that the animation order is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Resize UITableView</li>
<li>Perform rotation animation</li>
<li>Resize UIToolbar</li>

<p>While researching this, I found some people suggesting to change the UIWindow's background color to match your view (blue in this case), but my real UITableView does not have a solid color background, so this method is not sufficient.</p>

<p>I would like to be able to control when the rotation of individual views occur so that I can prevent this white border from being visible during rotation. Or if there is a better approach, please share that too!</p>

"How to store a list in a column of a database table <p>So, per <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/444251/how-to-store-a-list-in-a-db-column"">Mehrdad's answer to a related question</a>, I <em>get it</em> that a ""proper"" database table column doesn't store a list.  Rather, you should create another table that effectively holds the elements of said list and then link to it directly or through a junction table.  However, the type of list I want to create will be composed of unique items (unlike the linked question's <em>fruit</em> example).  Furthermore, the items in my list are explicitly sorted - which means that if I stored the elements in another table, I'd have to sort them every time I accessed them.  Finally, the list is basically atomic in that any time I wish to access the list, I will want to access the entire list rather than just a piece of it - so it seems silly to have to issue a database query to gather together pieces of the list.</p>

<p>AKX's solution (linked above) is to serialize the list and store it in a binary column.  But this also seems inconvenient because it means that I have to worry about serialization and deserialization.  </p>

<p>Is there any better solution?  If there <em>is</em> no better solution, then why?  It seems that this problem should come up from time to time.</p>

<p>... just a little more info to let you know where I'm coming from.  As soon as I had just begun understanding SQL and databases in general, I was turned on to LINQ to SQL, and so now I'm a little spoiled because I expect to deal with my programming object model without having to think about how the objects are queried or stored in the database.</p>

<p>Thanks All!</p>

<p>John</p>

<p>UPDATE:  So in the first flurry of answers I'm getting, I see ""you can go the CSV/XML route... but DON'T!"".  So now I'm looking for explanations of why.  Point me to some good references.  </p>

<p>Also, to give you a better idea of what I'm up to:  In my database I have a Function table that will have a list of (x,y) pairs.  (The table will also have other information that is of no consequence for our discussion.)  I will never need to see part of the list of (x,y) pairs.  Rather, I will take all of them and plot them on the screen.  I will allow the user to drag the nodes around to change the values occasionally or add more values to the plot.</p>

"Duplicate Referrer Header - HTTP.sys barfs <p>I have been testing the PS3 browser (NetFront) with embedded Flash components on a web page and there seems to be a rather serious bug with the way that any requests from Flash are issued. The browser is adding a referrer (referer) and so is the Flash player resulting in duplicate headers. This is actually OK if the referrer headers are the same, however they are not, and as a result the request is stopped by http.sys on W2k8. This is a major issue for me as I have a Flash component that needs to call web services in order to function.</p>

<p>Is there some way that we can filter or allow these requests through, possibly stripping the duplicate headers along the way.</p>

<p>Some solutions that we have thought of but are either suboptimal or not possible with our development and live environments are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding a proxy in front of the servers to clean the request.</li>
<li>Fixing the request at our load balancers. This may work on our live environment but not in dev. Also using a load balancer to perform this operation is bad practise, our operations team would not be pleased :)</li>
<li>Send all data to Flash during initialisation via flashvars. Possibly doing any updates/callbacks via Javascript. This feels messy and is would require significant custom code for one platform.</li>
<li>Prevent the browser or Flash from sending referrer headers. This would be acceptable, however there doesn't seem to be a way of enabling this in Flash or NetFront.</li>
</ul> 

<p>For reference the following request will reproduce the problem (copy and paste into Fiddler or other tool, I'm assuming you are running IIS7, W2K8 as we are). You should get a <code>400 Bad Request</code> response.</p>

  backend server to stitch together the
  HTML page. During this time, the
  browser is idle as it waits for the
  data to arrive. In PHP you have the
  function flush(). It allows you to
  send your partially ready HTML

"In Hadoop where does the framework save the output of the Map task in a normal Map-Reduce Application? <p>I am trying to find out where does the output of a Map task is saved to disk before it can be used by a Reduce task.</p>

        context.write(word, one);

"Determine Maximum Possible DIV Height <p>Is there a recommended way to determine the maximum height that a DIV can be set and remain visible per browser? This doesn't appear to be documented anywhere and is highly implementation specific.</p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/NP5Pa/2/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://jsfiddle.net/NP5Pa/2/</a></p>

<p>This is a simple test to find the maximum value you can set a DIV style height attribute before the corresponding <code>clientHeight</code> of the element becomes 0. You can confirm this by clicking ""Find Max"" then incrementing the found height by 1 and clicking ""Set Height"".</p>

"Scala Functional Literals with Implicits <p>Forgive me if this has already been asked elsewhere.  I have a Scala syntax question involving function-values and implicit parameters.  </p>

<p>I'm comfortable using implicits with Scala's currying feature.  For instance if I had a sum function and wanted to make the second argument an implicit:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; def sum(a: Int)(implicit b: Int) = a + b
sum: (a: Int)(implicit b: Int)Int
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to do this using the function-value syntax?  Ignoring the implicit for a moment, I typically write curried function-values like this:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; val sum2 = (a: Int) =&gt; (b: Int) =&gt; a + b
sum: (Int) =&gt; (Int) =&gt; Int = &lt;function1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, the function signature in the second approach is much different (the currying is being expressed explicitly).  Just adding the implicit keyword to b doesn't make much sense and the compiler complains as well:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; val sum2 = (a: Int) =&gt; (implicit b: Int) =&gt; a + b
&lt;console&gt;:1: error: '=&gt;' expected but ')' found.
       val sum2 = (a: Int) =&gt; (implicit b: Int) =&gt; a + b
                                              ^
</code></pre>

<p>Furthermore partially-applying sum from the very first approach to get a function-value causes problems as well:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; val sumFunction = sum _
&lt;console&gt;:14: error: could not find implicit value for parameter b: Int
       val sumFunction = sum _
                         ^
</code></pre>

<p>This leads me to believe that functions that have implicit parameters must have said parameters determined when the function-value is created, not when the function-value is applied later on.  Is this really the case?  Can you ever use an implicit parameter with a function-value?</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

"How to fragment H264 Packets in RTP compliant with RFC3984 <p>I have the FFMPEG streaming baseline h264 video, which I have to encapsulate in RTP and send to SIP phones for their decoding. I am using Linphone with the h264 plugin for Windows and Mirial for the decoding progress. However, sometimes I get a huge frame size (3Kb ~ 9Kb) from the FFMPEG, which obviously doesn't fit in the MTU. </p>

<p>If I send these frames ""as is"" and trusting IP fragmentation feature, some phones are able to play it well enough, but others choke and can't decode the stream. I think this is because the stream is not compliant with the RFC 3984 that specifies that packets that don't fit in the MTU have to be separated into different NALUs and mark the end of a Frame with the Mark feature of RTP.</p>

<p>How do I know where I can ""cut"" the I or P frame? I noticed that fragmented h264 packets (the ones without the Mark label) sometimes finish in 0xF8 but couldn't quite get a pattern and in the RFC 3984 which describes how to send these packets over RTP doesn't specify how to do it. </p>

<p>UPDATE: Does anyone know how to tell the X264 library how to generate NALUs of a Max Size? that way i should be able to avoid this problem. Thanks everyone </p>

"Sync Adapter without Account <p>I need to fetch some data over the cloud from my app. I've watched the google IO video on RESTful android apps @ <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHXn3Kg2IQE&amp;t=43m58s"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHXn3Kg2IQE&amp;t=43m58s</a> It recommends in the final slides to use a SyncAdapter to integrate with the Android System.</p>

<p>Later I learned that one has to use an Account to implement SyncAdapter. My app does not use an account. Users can freely download data without registration. Can I still use SyncAdapter? Is there a stock dummy account that I could use?</p>

<p>Edit: I do have a content provider for my app so that's not a problem</p>

<p>Edit2: I've just looked at the Weather and Stock apps under Settings -> Accounts &amp; Sync. You can see that they allow syncing, but don't have a remove account button. On the other hand, Google, Facebook and Skype apps allow syncing PLUS they have a remove account button. This means Weather and Stock don't use accounts, whereas Google, Facebook and Skype do.</p>

"What is the fastest way to get the value of π? <p>I'm looking for the fastest way to obtain the value of π, as a personal challenge. More specifically, I'm using ways that don't involve using <code>#define</code> constants like <code>M_PI</code>, or hard-coding the number in.</p>

<p>The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable. I've included it as a baseline to compare against the other versions. In my tests, with built-ins, the <code>4 * atan(1)</code> version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the <code>atan(1)</code> into a constant. With <code>-fno-builtin</code> specified, the <code>atan2(0, -1)</code> version is fastest.</p>

<p>Here's the main testing program (<code>pitimes.c</code>):</p>

"How to stop a running method with keyboard input in a Console Application on C#? <p>In short, I'm utilizing C# to scientific computation and I've written a method that has a while loop that may run to a user-specified quantity of steps... Actually, this method may take too long to execute (like more than 5 hours). When it takes this long, I may want to stop the method pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> key, for example.</p>

<p>As I read something about breaking <code>while</code>, it is as simple as a <code>Boolean</code> flag or something like this. So I thought in something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public Double? Run(int n)
{
    int i = 0;
    while ((i &lt; n) &amp;&amp; (/* inputkey != ConsoleKey.Escape */))
    {
        // here goes the heavy computation thing
        // and I need to read some ""inputkey"" as well to break this loop
        i++;
    }
    // I'm not worried about the return statement, as it is easy to do...
    // returns null if the user skipped the method by pressing Escape
    // returns null if the method didn't converged
    // returns the double value that the method calculated otherwise
}
</code></pre>

<p>Well, this is what I wondered until now... So please, could you give useful ideas to this extent? How can I wait for a user input (I thought about <code>Events</code>, but I'm not sure how to implement it here and I think that it will make the code even slower, if I have to listen to a key at every while step the code goes into...</p>

<p>Well, any ideas or comments?</p>

But, if i press down-arrow key on keyboard, it cycles thru the options in the order I've inserted, but never does it show more than 1 option in the box. So, In case an user wants to select option3, he has to cycle through options 1 and 2 !! Though once I select any option using the keyboard, the appropriate event handlers are fired, I'm miffed by this behaviour , as is understandable.</p>

"Pointcut matching methods with annotated parameters <p>I need to create an aspect with a pointcut matching a method if:</p>

<li>Is public</li>
<li>Its class is annotated with @Controller  <strong><em>(Finally does not)</em></strong></li>
<li>One of its parameters (can have many) is annotated with @MyParamAnnotation.</li>

<p>I think the first two conditions are easy, but I don't know if its possible to accomplish the third with Spring. If it is not, maybe I can change it into:</p>

"Getting a 'No thread-bound request found' error from spring in my web app <p>I'm getting a 'No thread-bound request found' error in my web app and hoping to get some help.
I'm trying to use struts2 + spring + hibernate, and use spring to manage the hibernate session factory, and inject hibernate sessions into my struts actions. I hope that made sense.
When the app starts up, there are no errors, but when i make the first web request it bombs out with the 'No thread-bound request found' error.
Here's my spring config:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC ""-//SPRING//DTD BEAN 2.0//EN"" ""http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans-2.0.dtd""&gt;
&lt;beans&gt;
  &lt;bean id=""hibernateSessionFactory"" scope=""singleton""
    class=""org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.LocalSessionFactoryBean""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""configLocation"" value=""classpath:hibernate.cfg.xml"" /&gt;
  &lt;/bean&gt;
  &lt;bean id=""hibernateSession"" factory-bean=""hibernateSessionFactory""
    factory-method=""openSession"" destroy-method=""close"" scope=""request"" class=""org.hibernate.Session"" /&gt;
&lt;/beans&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here's my action:</p>

<pre><code>package actions.events;
import org.hibernate.Session;

public class Listing {
  Session session;
  public void setHibernateSession(Session value) throws Exception
  {
    session = value;
  }

  public String execute() {
    return ""success"";
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My only lead is that if i remove the 'setHibernateSession' function above, i don't get the error because presumably spring doesn't bother creating a session if the action doesn't need one (lazy instantiation).</p>

<p>And here's the exception:</p>

<pre><code>Unable to instantiate Action, actions.events.Listing, defined for 'Listing' in namespace '/events'Error creating bean with name 'hibernateSession': Scope 'request' is not active for the current thread; consider defining a scoped proxy for this bean if you intend to refer to it from a singleton; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalStateException: No thread-bound request found: Are you referring to request attributes outside of an actual web request, or processing a request outside of the originally receiving thread?

"Qt: How to create windows DLL (that exports functions)? <p>I need to create a windows DLL that exports functions and has a graphical user interface.  The reason for the GUI in the DLL is that the DLL serves as a kind of plugin for another 3rd party application.  Currently I only have access to Visual Studio Express which AFAIK doesn't support MFC so I'm looking for alternative ways to create a GUI in a DLL.  After some research I came across Qt which seems promising.  And it seems like it might be easier to just use the Qt Creator IDE rather than Visual Studio Express. </p>

<p>However, how do I create a windows DLL in Qt Creator? (I guess a regular DLL, I don't think a COM or managed DLL will work)</p>

"Pros and cons for different configuration formats? <p>I've seen people using *.cfg (Python Buildout), *.xml (Gnome), *.json (Chrome extension), *.yaml (Google App Engine), *.ini and even *.py for app configuration files (like Django).</p>

<p>My question is: why there are so many different configuration file formats?

<p>I know there are even more formats than those configuration files I exemplified. What are really their advantages in comparison to each other? Historical reasons? Compatibility with different systems?</p>

"Best practice on PHP singleton classes <blockquote>
  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>
  <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4595964/who-needs-singletons"">Who needs singletons?</a>  </p>
</blockquote>



<p>I always write with respect to <em>best practice</em>, but I also want to understand why a given thing is a <em>best practice</em>.</p>

<p>I've read on in an article (I unfortunately don't remember) that singleton classes are prefered to be instantiated, rather than being made with static functions and accessed with the scope resolution operator (::). So if I have a class that contains all my tools to validate, in short:</p>

<pre><code>class validate {
    private function __construct(){}
    public static function email($input){
        return true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've been told this is considered <em>bad practice</em> (or at least warned against), because of such things as the garbage collector and maintenance. So what the critiques of the ""singleton class as static methods"" wants, is that I instantiate a class I'm 100% certain I will only ever instantiate once. To me it seems like doing ""double work"", because it's all ready there. What am I missing?</p>

<p>What's the view on the matter? Of course it's not a life and death issue, but one might as well do a thing the right way, if the option is there :)</p>

"Center a 'div' in the middle of the screen, even when the page is scrolled up or down? <p>I have in my page a button which when clicked displays a <code>div</code> (popup style) in the middle of my screen.</p>

"Manually instantiate a Controller instance from an arbitrary URL? <p>My skills are failing me, and I know I've seen the code around for this but I can't find it.</p>

"How to give /dev/bus/usb permissions for libusb android applications? <p>i am developing an Application that uses libusb via jni.
this application is currently targeted only to rooted, usb-host
Android 3+ machines.</p>

<p>the scenario is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;java Activity&gt;
       loads &lt;jni_wrapper.so&gt;
               which wraps &lt;my_main_lib.so&gt;
                       that uses &lt;libusb.so&gt;
                               that needs rw access to: /dev/bus/usb/&lt;device&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>all the .so native libraries are part of an infrastructure that i install (as root) on /system/lib,
which then can be used by java Activities, run by the simple users.</p>

<p>that means that the whole usb communication must be done from the native side.</p>

<p>i got everything to work fine, except for one issue - the usb permissions:
the default permissions of /dev/bus/usb/ entries are (0660, uid= root, gid= usb).</p>

<p>obviously, a standard java process running a native code does not meet any of the above requirements, forcing me to ""chmod 666"" the corresponding /dev entry, to get this working.</p>

<p>this solution is not so good, though, because it does not survive reboot, or unplugging/replugging of the device (permissions go back to 0660).</p>

<p>the solution i'm looking for needs to:</p>

<ul>
<li>survive reboot/replugging</li>
<li>be installed ~once~ by the root, and not involve bothering the user every time to gain permissions</li>
<li>be generic and run on all (/most) android 3+ machines</li>
<li>[not mandatory] gives the minimal credentials necessary</li>
</ul>

<p>directions i thought of:</p>

<ul>
<li>changing permissions in /init.rc or /ueventd.rc --> both are overridden on every reboot </li>
<li>mounting usbfs /proc/bus/usb with devmode=0666  --> survives replugging, but not reboot</li>
<li>making my process join the ""usb"" group? --> i tried android.permission.ACCESS_USB, but it doesnt work/supported... :/</li>
</ul>

<p>any ideas? :-)</p>

<br>2. I have logged in using a sandboxed account to gamecenter (made 2 accounts incase one wasn't sandbox). I did see the word ""sandbox"" with some numbers/letters on the top left while signing up for an account, so I'm 100% sure I have a sandboxed account. Tried 2 different sandbox accounts. Tried on 2 different devices (ipad/iphone). Also tried on the iPhone simulator.

"Using Rails 3.1, where do you put your ""page specific"" JavaScript code? <p>To my understanding, all of your JavaScript gets merged into 1 file. Rails does this by default when it adds <code>//= require_tree .</code> to the bottom of your <code>application.js</code> manifest file. </p>

<p>This sounds like a real life-saver, but I am a little concerned about page-specific JavaScript code. Does this code get executed on every page? The last thing I want is for all of my objects to be instantiated for every page when they are only needed on 1 page. </p>

<p>Also, isn't there potential for code that clashes too?</p>

<p>Or do you put a small <code>script</code> tag at the bottom of the page that just calls into a method that executes the javascript code for the page?</p>

<p>Do you no longer need require.js then?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I appreciate all the answers... and I don't think they are really getting at the problem. Some of them are about styling and don't seem to relate... and others just mention <code>javascript_include_tag</code>... which I know exists (obviously...) but it would appear that the Rails 3.1 way going forward is to wrap up all of your JavaScript into 1 file rather than loading individual JavaScript at the bottom of each page.</p>

<p>The best solution I can come up with is to wrap certain features in <code>div</code> tags with <code>id</code>s or <code>class</code>es. In the JavaScript code, you just check if the <code>id</code> or <code>class</code> is on the page, and if it is, you run the JavaScript code that is associated with it. This way if the dynamic element is not on the page, the JavaScript code doesn't run - even though it's been included in the massive <code>application.js</code> file packaged by Sprockets.</p>

<p>My above solution has the benefit that if a search box is included on 8 of the 100 pages, it will run on only those 8 pages. You also won't have to include the same code on 8 of the pages on the site. In fact, you'll never have to include manual script tags on your site anywhere ever again.</p>

<p>I think this is the actual answer to my question.</p>

"How to force a MSTEST TestMethod to reset all singletons/statics before running? <p>I'm using MSTEST inside Visual Studio 2008. How can I have each unit test method in a certain test class act as if it were the first test to run so that all global state is reset before running each test? I do not want to explicitly clean up the world using TestInitialize, ClassInitialize, AssemblyInitialize, etc. For example:</p>

<pre><code>[TestClass]
public class MyClassTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void Test1()
    {
       // The ""Instance"" property creates a new instance of ""SomeSingleton""
       // if it hasn't been created before.
       var i1 = SomeSingleton.Instance;
       ...
    }
    [TestMethod]
    public void Test2()
    {
       // When I select ""Test1"" and ""Test2"" to run, I'd like Test2
       // to have a new AppDomain feel so that the static variable inside
       // of ""SomeSingleton"" is reset (it was previously set in Test1) on
       // the call to "".Instance""
       var i2 = SomeSingleton.Instance;
       // some code
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Although a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/154180/how-does-nunit-and-mstest-handle-tests-that-change-staticshared-variables"">similar question</a> appeared on this topic, it only clarified that tests do not run in parallel. I realize that tests run serially, but there doesn't seem to be a way to explicitly force a new AppDomain for each method (or something equivalent to clear all state).</p>

<p>Ideally, I'd like to specify this behavior for only a small subset of my unit tests so that I don't have to pay the penalty of a new AppDomain creation for tests that don't care about global state (the vast majority of my tests).</p>

"Use of typename keyword with typedef and new <p>Consider this code,</p>
<pre><code>template&lt;class T&gt;
struct Sample
{ 
     typename T::X *x; //declare pointer to T's X
};
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, the keyword <code>typename</code> is required by the compiler, so that it can disambiguate between nested types and nested values in templates. That means, in the absence of <code>typename</code> keyword, compiler would interpret this as multiplication of T::X with x,</p>
<pre><code>T::X *x; //multiply T::X with x
</code></pre>
<p>So in such situations where ambiguity can arise, the keyword <code>typename</code> becomes <strong>necessity</strong> so as to remove ambiguities. But there are few situations when the context itself removes ambiguities. The <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4347730/use-of-typename-keyword-with-template-function-parameters"">other topic</a> discusses contexts of base-class and function-parameters (the latter doesn't remove ambiguity though). In this topic, I particularly want to discuss other two contexts which seem to be <strong>unambiguous</strong>, but we're still required to write <code>typename</code>,</p>
<pre><code>typedef typename T::X xtype;
pX = new typename T::X;  
</code></pre>
<p>In these two situations, the keywords <code>typedef</code> and <code>new</code> make it clear enough to the compiler that whatever follows is <em>type</em>, <strong>not</strong> <em>value</em>.</p>
<p>So my question is, why do compilers still need the <code>typename</code> keyword, even in unambiguous situations such as when we use <code>typedef</code> and <code>new</code>?</p>
<hr />
<h1>EDIT (after reading this response from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/34509/johannes-schaub-litb"">Johannes Schaub</a>) :</h1>
<pre><code>//typedef NOT followed by a type!
int typedef A;
</code></pre>
<p>This syntax asks me to modify my question a little bit, so that the point which I'm trying to make, may be seen by others.</p>
<p>Consider this,</p>
<pre><code>T::X typedef *x;
</code></pre>
<p>So from the context, it's still clear enough to the compiler that T::X is a type, no matter whether it appears <em>before</em> <code>typedef</code>,or <em>after</em> <code>typedef</code>. <strong>Unless C++ allows us to write <code>typedef 5 five</code>  or <code>typedef T::value t_value</code> (where T::value is <em>value</em>), the presence of <code>typedef</code> itself removes all ambiguities and so, <code>typename</code> seems to be an unnecessary requirement by the Standard (in such situations)</strong>. Same argument holds true for <code>new</code> as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>Also, I've written a class template which is using this struct as template argument:</p>
<pre><code>struct A 
{
        struct X { string name; };
        static const int X = 100;
};
</code></pre>
<p>I particularly want to know if the following code (from the constructor) is correct (portable) or not,</p>

"What happens if I cast a function pointer, changing the number of parameters <p>I'm just beginning to wrap my head around function pointers in C.

"How to Develop Dynamic Plug-In Based Functionality in C# <p>I've been looking around for different methods of providing plug-in support for my application.

What are the some methods available for making a C# application extensible via a plug-in architecture?</p>

<p>Lets make up an example. If we have a program that consists of a main menu ( File, Edit, View, et al. ) along with a TreeView that displays different brands of cars grouped by manufacturer ( Ford, GM, for now). Right clicking on a car displays a context menu with the only option being 'delete car'. </p>

<p>How could you develop the application so that plug-ins could be deployed so that you could allow one customer to see a new brand in the TreeView, let's say Honda, and also extent the car context menu so that they may now 'paint a car'?</p>

<p>In Eclipse/RCP development this is easily handled by extension points and plug-ins. How does C# handle it? I've been looking into developing my own plug-in architecture and reading up on MEF.</p>

"""JScript - script block"" and memory leaks - How to freeing up resources properly? <p>I put some jquery tabs inside a partial view of my project. I noticed by Visual Studio's ""Solution Explorer"", that during debug <strong>a new dynamic <code>JScript - script block</code> is generated every time I click on a new tab</strong>. </p>

<p>This happens even if I put <code>$('#mytabs .ui-tabs-hide').children().remove();</code> and <code>$("".ui-tabs-hide"").empty();</code> inside <code>show</code> event of the tabs. 
Script blocks contains javascript i put inside the partial views called by tabs, so <strong>every time I click a previously clicked tab, a new JScript block appears</strong>: it is evident that this leads to problems of stability or memory leaks...for example, I already noticed that some timers and bindings do not work properly after I load twice a tab.</p>

<p>I do not know if the problem is induced by the way in which call the partial views containing the scripts. Please be careful how I set the controller actions (Index in the example).</p>

<p><strong>This is my environment: jquery 1.6.4 - jquery-ui 1.8.16 - IE 8.0.7601</strong>
I cannot succeed to debug with other browsers, because Visual Studio does not seems to attach their processes and does not show dynamic data...</p>

<p><strong>CONTROLLER</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here is an action example called by the tabs</strong></p>

<pre><code>  public ActionResult Index()
    {
         if (Request.IsAjaxRequest())
            return PartialView(""_Index"");

        return View(); 
    }

<p><strong>Here are some parts of my views and scripts:</strong></p>

        &lt;li&gt;@Html.ActionLink(""Test"", ""Index"", ""Test"")&lt;/li&gt;
         ...
    &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

"Which Stack-Overflow style Markdown (WMD) JavaScript editor should we use? <h2>Background</h2>

<p>I'm working on an application which requires user-entered content, and I've decided to use a Stack Overflow-style Markdown editor. After researching this topic for the last few days, I realize there are numerous forks of the base WMD editor, some with a few basic enhancements and some with serious differences from the Stack Overflow one.</p>

<p>Since this will be the heart of the application, I'd like to start with the best code base I can. I'd be happy if anyone can recommend which one of the many solutions out there best fits my needs.</p>

<p>Below are requirements, plus what I've managed to find already. I'm hoping this question will help me decide which version to go with, and maybe help me discover a port that's an even better fit for my needs.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The requirements for my project</h2>

<ul>
<li>Live preview</li>
<li>Multiple editors on the same page (I do not know how many in advance, since the user can dynamically add another editing box).</li>
<li>Ability to extend with extra buttons (I'd like a button to upload a picture, instead of just adding an <code>img</code> URL).</li>
<li>Ability to dynamically show/hide the edit box (and only see the preview box).</li>
<li>Not an absolute must, but I'd prefer to stick as close to Stack Overflow's look and feel, since it's well known.</li>
<li>Don't know if this matters, but the backend is written in Django.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Editors I've looked at</h2>

<p>Here are a few of the code bases I've looked at, with thoughts. Obviously, I might be missing another solution out there.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href=""http://github.com/derobins/wmd"" rel=""noreferrer"">derobins</a> version. From what I can tell, this is the official Stack Overflow version. Seems like it doesn't support multiple editors on one page.</li>
<li><a href=""http://github.com/tstone/jquery-markedit"" rel=""noreferrer"">jQuery.MarkEdit</a>. Looks very good, but is pretty different from the Stack Overflow version.</li>
<li><a href=""http://moowmd.awardspace.info/moowmd-tutorial.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">MooWMD</a>. Looks like the winner right now, but I'm a little concerned since it looks less active/hackable than MarkEdit.</li>
<li>The <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/wmd-new/"" rel=""noreferrer"">wmd-new</a> version. Not sure, looks like an old codebase without much use.</li>
<li>The <a href=""http://github.com/ananthakumaran/wmd/"" rel=""noreferrer"">SocialSite branch</a>. Seems like it's not for public use.</li>

<p>As an exercise I am writing a memory manager - that is, <strong>the code which implements malloc, realloc and free</strong> (or new and delete.)  The RTL for my language, Delphi, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15506828/what-memory-management-algorithms-are-well-regarded-and-used-by-major-compiler-v"">allows the RTL's memory manager to be replaced easily</a>.

<p>I'm looking for resources about high-quality approaches others have taken to the same problem and am trying to find out what algorithms other major compiler vendors use.  While Delphi's is well documented, I cannot find any information about the implementations used by MS VC++, .Net, or Objective C.  These vendors do not seem (?) to allow their RTL to be hooked into like Delphi does.  All documentation seems to be higher-level, such as <code>NSAutoReleasePool</code> to pick a random example - far too high-level for this question.</p>

<p><strong>What memory management algorithms do major vendors (Microsoft VC++ and .Net, and Apple Objective C) use in their runtime libraries?</strong> </p>

<li>MS VC++: unknown.</li>
<li>.Net: unknown.</li>

"""JScript - script block"" and memory leaks - How to freeing up resources properly? <p>I put some jquery tabs inside a partial view of my project. I noticed by Visual Studio's ""Solution Explorer"", that during debug <strong>a new dynamic <code>JScript - script block</code> is generated every time I click on a new tab</strong>. </p>

<p>This happens even if I put <code>$('#mytabs .ui-tabs-hide').children().remove();</code> and <code>$("".ui-tabs-hide"").empty();</code> inside <code>show</code> event of the tabs. 
Script blocks contains javascript i put inside the partial views called by tabs, so <strong>every time I click a previously clicked tab, a new JScript block appears</strong>: it is evident that this leads to problems of stability or memory leaks...for example, I already noticed that some timers and bindings do not work properly after I load twice a tab.</p>

<p>I do not know if the problem is induced by the way in which call the partial views containing the scripts. Please be careful how I set the controller actions (Index in the example).</p>

<p><strong>This is my environment: jquery 1.6.4 - jquery-ui 1.8.16 - IE 8.0.7601</strong>
I cannot succeed to debug with other browsers, because Visual Studio does not seems to attach their processes and does not show dynamic data...</p>

"SOAP web service calls from Javascript <p>I'm struggling to successfully make a web service call to a SOAP web service from a web page. The web service is a Java web service that uses JAX-WS.</p>

<p>Here is the web method that I'm trying to call:</p>

<pre><code>@WebMethod  
public String sayHi(@WebParam(name=""name"") String name)  
{  
    System.out.println(""Hello ""+name+""!"");  
    return ""Hello ""+name+""!"";  
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried doing the web service call using the JQuery library jqSOAPClient (<a href=""http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jqSOAPClient"">http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jqSOAPClient</a>).<br>
Here is the code that I've used:</p>

<pre><code>var processResponse = function(respObj)  
{  
    alert(""Response received: ""+respObj);  
};

SOAPClient.Proxy = url;  
var body = new SOAPObject(""sayHi"");  
body.ns = ns;  
body.appendChild(new SOAPObject(""name"").val(""Bernhard""));

var sr = new SOAPRequest(ns+""sayHi"",body);  
SOAPClient.SendRequest(sr,processResponse);
</code></pre>

<p>No response seems to be coming back. When in <code>jqSOAPClient.js</code> I log the <code>xData.responseXML</code> data member I get 'undefined'. In the web service I see the warning</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>24 Mar 2011 10:49:51 AM com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.server.WSHttpHandler handleExchange
  WARNING: Cannot handle HTTP method: OPTIONS</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've also tried using a javascript library, soapclient.js (<a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/kb/Ajax/JavaScriptSOAPClient.aspx"">http://www.codeproject.com/kb/Ajax/JavaScriptSOAPClient.aspx</a>). The client side code that I use here is </p>

<pre><code>var processResponse = function(respObj) 
{
    alert(""Response received: ""+respObj);
};

var paramaters = new SOAPClientParameters();
paramaters.add(""name"",""Bernhard"");
SOAPClient.invoke(url,""sayHi"",paramaters,true,processResponse);
</code></pre>

<p>I've bypassed the part in soapclient.js that fetches the WSDL, since it doesn't work 
(I get an: <code>IOException: An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine</code> on the web service side). The WSDL is only retrieved for the appropriate name space to use, so I've just replaced the variable ns with the actual name space.</p>

<p>I get exactly the same warning on the web service as before (cannot handle HTTP method: OPTIONS) and in the browser's error console I get the error ""document is null"". When I log the value of req.responseXML in soapclient.js I see that it is null.</p>

<p>Could anyone advise on what might be going wrong and what I should do to get this to work?</p>

"Does LINQ use DataRelations to optimize joins? <p>I can't find the answer to this anywhere, and before I start pawing through generated code with Reflector I thought it'd be worth asking:</p>

"Fix key settings (Home/End/Insert/Delete) in .zshrc when running Zsh in Terminator Terminal Emulator <p>I'm running Ubuntu 11.04. I installed the <a href=""http://software.jessies.org/terminator/"">Terminator Terminal Emulator</a> 0.95, and Zsh, version 4.3.15. <br/>
I have (commonly known) problems with my keys inside the Zsh. At least these:</p>

<ul>
<li>Home/End, nothing happens</li>
<li>Insert/Delete/PageUp/PageDown: a ""~"" is typed</li>
</ul>

<p>I already tried some configurations for .zshrc which should solve the problem, but no approach really worked so far. Maybe this is related to the combination of Terminator and Zsh.

"Using nearest-neighbor with CSS zoom on canvas (and img) <p>When using the CSS <code>zoom</code> property, how can I convince the browser to use ""nearest neighbor"", instead of ""bilinear"" or any other more advanced zooming algorithms?</p>

<p>My setup is a div that contains a canvas, and the div gets its zoom set via JavaScript to be <code>&lt;div style=""zoom:3200%""&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code> and to get nearest neighbor, I am using <code>image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast</code> in my CSS. The app is available <a href=""http://www.lovetopixel.com"">here</a> ('z' zooms in, 'shift-z' zooms back out), and my css is <a href=""http://www.lovetopixel.com/ltp.css"">here</a></p>

<p>Here is the desired effect in Chrome on OSX (zoom is set to 3200%):
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/JMpbI.png"" alt=""zoom on OSX/Chrome using nearest neighbor""></p>

<p>But here is the same thing in Chrome on Windows 7:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/NdY5w.png"" alt=""zoom on Windows/Chrome not using nearest neighbor""></p>

<p>In both cases it is ""vanilla"" Chrome (version 15.x.x) out of the box, no experimental flags are turned on.</p>

<p><strong>How can I convince Chrome on Windows to use nearest neighbor? For that matter, how can I convince all browsers?</strong> Safari also does not use nearest neighbor (so far the app only works in WebKit based browsers)</p>

<p>The CSS <code>image-rendering</code> property does affect Chrome/OSX and gives me the desired effect. But Chrome/Windows and Safari(5.1)/OSX both seem to completely ignore it. Something tells me I'm just out of luck, but I figured I'd ask.</p>

<p>Using <code>zoom</code> on the div container is so simple and works beautifully in Chrome/OSX, if I must resort to scaling my canvases internally, I can do that too. But would prefer the literally one line of code solution if possible!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I have found the use of <code>image-rendering: optimizeSpeed</code> helps. However it seems finicky in Chrome/Windows. If I set it on too many elements (I initially tried, my containers and all canvases), it doesn't take effect. But if I apply it to just <code>canvas</code>, I get 98% of the way there.</p>

<p>Now my problem is the first time I draw while zoomed in, it works perfectly, all other subsequent drawing actions are fuzzy while they are taking place, then revert to the correct nearest-neighbor afterwards (my app draws into a scratch canvas first, then applies the drawing to the real canvas). There is something odd about the scratch canvas where Chrome insists on using bilinear. I think with some digging I can resolve that.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE2:</strong> It seems like <code>image-rendering</code> on Chrome/Windows just isn't implemented well and is a bit buggy. I can now confirm that the values <code>optimizeSpeed</code> and <code>optimizeQuality</code> are not supported on Chrome/Windows. If you set image-rendering to them, Chrome will ignore the set. Chrome/Windows does recognize <code>-webkit-optimize-contrast</code>, however it does not use it consistently. Chrome will flip between what looks to be a bilinear scaling algorithm and nearest-neighbor almost at random. I've not been able to consistently get Chrome to use nearest-neighbor.</p>

<p>I tried a build of Chromium 17 on Windows and it behaves the same way.</p>

<p>Firefox (8.0.1) is looking pretty promising though as it does seem to honor <code>-moz-crisp-edges</code> quite well. Originally I was targeting Chrome as my ""ideal browser"" for this app, I might just switch over to Firefox.</p>

<p>In the end, it seems like proper support for <code>image-rendering</code> is in the pipeline for Chrome, just not quite there yet. WebKit itself claims to fully support all image-rendering values, but I'm guessing the build of WebKit that Chrome uses hasn't quite updated to this new fix.</p>

"Dialog breaks when using GtkBuilder to automatically connect signals, but works when manually connecting signals <p>I want to have a dialog window where some buttons close the dialog and others don't. The way I do this is by using the <code>response</code> signal from the <code>Gtk.Dialog</code> to call <code>emit_stop_by_name('response')</code> on the dialog. (If someone knows of a better way of doing this, that might preempt the whole rest of this question.)</p>

<p>This worked when I used PyGTK. I'm moving to PyGObject now.. and it seems that this technique will work <em>only</em> if I manually connect to the response signal rather than using <code>Gtk.Builder.connect_signals()</code>.</p>

<p>But don't take my word for it. Here is a minimal example of my problem:</p>

    &lt;/action-widgets&gt;

<p>When you run this, you get a window with a single button. When you click that button, a dialog pops up with two buttons, one labeled ""Don't Close Dialog"" and another labeled ""Close Dialog"". When running the code above, both buttons will close the dialog.</p>

<p>But if you change from using <code>Gtk.Builder.connect_signals()</code> to manually connecting the signal by replacing</p>

<pre><code>        self.builder.connect_signals(self)

<p>with</p>

<pre><code>        self.dialog1.connect('response', self.on_response)
</code></pre>

<p>then it starts working as designed (the ""Don't Close Dialog"" button doesn't close the dialog).</p>

<p><strong>But shouldn't those two lines be exactly functionally identical</strong> in this context? Is there any way to figure out what's different between the two scenarios?</p>

<p>I can tell the signals are still connected in both situations because the text is still printed to the CLI from <code>DummyDialog.on_response</code>. But it seems like the <code>widget.emit_stop_by_name('response')</code> part stops working when I use GtkBuilder.</p>

<p>Even more perplexing is that if you take this exact code and run it on PyGTK (change <code>from gi.repository import Gtk</code> to <code>import gtk as Gtk</code>), then it works correctly in both scenarios (using <code>self.builder.connect_signals(self)</code> or <code>self.dialog1.connect('response', self.on_response)</code>).</p>

"Public Transportation using Buses in City <p>I am developing a Journey Planner website. There are few things that are simple in this case currently i.e. Right now the website will only be able to plan bus routes, the timings of buses are not currently available. So this means we only have bus routes stored in the db and since bus timings are not available so waiting times for traveler are not relevant as well. What is available is the time and distance covered between two stops for an individual bus. </p>

<p>I think that using an undirected weighted graph storing the time and distance costs of each bus stop for each individual bus would be the way to go. Then I could use Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two locations entered by the user based on either time or distance as per user preference. I would find out whether two or three buses are required through simple C# functions if the bus routes intersect at stops and then using those intersection stops for the traveler to change the bus. But there would be an individual graph for each bus. An alternative (not sure if this is correct) way would be to use a graph containing every bus stop of city as nodes and then using this technique to find out the way to travel between two stops. Which is the correct approach? Should I use A* algorithm in place of Dijkstra algo?</p>

<p>A few general points for the design: I would like the app to be extensible so I could add other transportation means later when the need arises. Moreover the bus times could also be added later if possible without major changes to the website. I have seen quite a few experts here who have worked on much complex projects of transportation. So please help me out with the best way to implement this functionality in the most scalable, modular and extensible fashion. </p>

"combining packed data with aligned memory access <p>I'm trying to perform a memory optimization that should be theoretically possible but that I'm starting to doubt is within arm-elf-gcc's capability.  Please show me that I'm wrong.</p>
<p>I have an embedded system with a very small amount of main memory, and an even smaller amount of battery-backed nvram.  I am storing checksummed configuration data in the nvram so that on boot I can validate the checksum and continue a previous run or start a new run if the checksum is invalid.  During the run, I update various fields of various sizes in this configuration data (and it's okay that this invalidates the checksum until it is later recalculated).</p>
<p>All of this runs in physical address space - the normal sram is mapped at one location and the nvram is mapped at another.  Here's the rub - all access to the nvram must be done in 32-bit words; no byte or halfword access is allowed (although it's obviously fine in main memory).</p>
<p>So I can either a) store a working copy of all of my configuration data in main memory, and memcpy it out to the nvram when I recalculate the checksum or b) work with it directly in nvram but somehow convince the compiler that all structs are packed and all accesses must not only be 32-bit <em>aligned</em>, but also 32-bit <em>wide</em>.</p>
<p>Option a) wastes precious main memory, and I would much rather make the runtime tradeoff to save it (although not if the code size ends up wasting more than I save on data size) via option b).</p>
<p>I was hoping that <code>__attribute__ ((packed, aligned(4)))</code> or some variation thereof could help here, but all of the reading and experimenting I have done so far has let me down.</p>
<p>Here's a toy example of the sort of configuration data I'm dealing with:</p>
<pre><code>#define __packed __attribute__ ((packed))
struct __packed Foo
{
    uint64_t foo;
    struct FooFoo foofoo;
}

struct __packed Bar
{
    uint32_t something;
    uint16_t somethingSmaller;
    uint8_t evenSmaller;
}

struct __packed PersistentData
{
    struct Foo;
    struct Bar;
    /* ... */
    struct Baz;
    uint_32 checksum;
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can imagine different threads (one each to perform functions Foo, Bar, and Baz) updating their own structures as appropriate, and synchronizing at some point to declare it time to recalculate the checksum and go to sleep.</p>

<p>For the record:</p>

<p>EDIT:
The reason I do this is that I'm not creating a simple web page but a large application. It is incredibly annoying to lose 10 minutes of work just because you pressed backspace in the wrong place. The ratio of preventing mistakes vs. annoying users should be way above 1000/1 by preventing the backspace key from navigating back.</p>

"iOS/iPhone: in-app purchase sandbox broken while app in ""rejected"" state? <p>(See <strong>MAIN THRUST</strong> below to skip to the main thrust of my question.)</p>

<p>My iOS app was rejected in the Apple review process for a minor reason that was easy to fix.</p>

<p>However, I wanted to give the new build a once-over testing, including retesting our in-app purchase (there is only a single purchasable item in the app).</p>

<p>And now the app crashes when doing the initial retrieval of the product information. It never crashed in this way before, and the code hasn't changed since we successfully tested the in-app purchase in sandbox mode many times. (In fact, no code changed at all between the initially submitted version and this version with the minor fix; the fix was just an info.plist setting change.)</p>

<p>To complicate matters, I'm using the Airplay/Marmalade SDK for building the app, and they wrap the Objective C calls and callback mechanism with their own API and callback mechanism. However, this wrapper is very thin, so I hope/believe that this is really a general iOS/in-app purchase question, not something specific to Marmalade.</p>

<p>So, as I say, it's crashing somewhere between the time I make the Marmalade call to retrieve product information and the time my (C++) callback should be called. (I.e., somewhere between the time that Marmalade calls [productsRequest start] on an SKProductsRequest object, and the time productsRequest:didReceiveResponse() is called and Marmalade calls me back in turn.)</p>

<p><strong>MAIN THRUST</strong> of my question:</p>

<p>My app is in ""rejected"" state on iTunesConnect. Furthermore, when I look at the in-app purchase item itself in iTunesConnect, it's also marked as ""Rejected"". However, I've already discussed my in-app purchase with Apple during the review process, and it is my belief that the in-app purchase itself works fine for them, and the only remaining problem was the minor issue that I've already fixed (this is what their rejection details said: just that one item).</p>

<p>So: I need to understand whether, when my app (and its associated in-app purchase) are in this ""rejected"" state pending a new binary upload from me, it's tricky (or maybe impossible) to re-test the in-app purchase, and my best course of action is just to resubmit the app with the minor fix and have faith that (since it's the same code that worked during normal testing when things weren't in the rejected state) the state of the in-app purchase will work itself out once Apple resets everything to test the new binary.</p>

<p>Or is there something different I should do at this point that would allow me to re-test the in-app purchase?</p>

<p>I was thinking of asking Apple in the iTunesConnect correspondence, but I didn't want to introduce any complications with them, since the review process has been amazingly fast and efficient so far.</p>

<p>I would like to bind the SelectedItem of the ComboBox to the property specified in the CustomObject, however <code>SelectedItem=""{Binding Path=CustomSettingProperty}""</code> is not setting the default selected item.

"Deep Cloning of Java objects (Not beans) <p>The project that I am currently working on has lot of objects that are serialized in order to get a deep copy of the the existing object. This works fine until we have multiple calls at runtime in some cased we have 100, 200, or even 1000 calls between components and this is where we are hit with performance headache.</p>

<p>Historical reason for copying these  objects being cloned is that , two different component working on same objects under different functionality should not change each other e.g. Changes in Swing UI should not change the object values in backend until save or synchronized button is pressed.</p>

<p>We have quite a large code base, I thought if I would write clone based on reflection it will work faster as compared to serialization , but either due to our complex hierarchies of objects or due to some other reason , this approach is even slower.</p>

<p>I also tried using CloneUtils (sourceforge project) , which is slower as well (We are not using Hibernate at all). Spring BeanUtils is not an option (I assume from docs that it only uses beans i.e. introspection and in case I use it if any fields are exposed using non standard accessor , we will not be able to copy those).  </p>

<p>Has anyone any idea , improve the performance while still working on different copies. We have an option which will speed up things in case we provide our own copy methods ,instead of serialization, but that has downside of updating these methods every time and if we forget we might loose functionality.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>So it appears to be a Castle Proxy component that's missing, but I'm referencing the binary from the <code>NET40-NoCastle</code> directory.</p>

<p>Latest version of Moq (Moq.4.0.10827)</p>

<p>And I'm new to Moq, so I may be doing something extremely dense.</p>

"Trigger jquery when 'Gravity Forms' input button is clicked <p>I've updated the question because it may because of gravity forms which is stopping a simple function from working. The reason I say this is because I've tried so many options (listed below) to trigger a jQuery function, and none of them work when they should.</p>

<p>I have a simple function below which 100% works...</p>

<pre><code>var $contactButton  = $("".contact-slide a""),
    $contactSlide   = $(""#horizon-slide"");

function () {
    $contactSlide.stop().css(""top"",""0"");
};
</code></pre>

<p>Simple as it gets, but I'm trying to trigger this when my submit button gets clicked from a gravity from.</p>

<p><br />
This is the wordpress gravity forms input markup...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type=""submit"" id=""gform_submit_button_1"" class=""button gform_button"" value=""Send"" tabindex=""7""&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><br />
These are all the scripts below that I've tried, but none of them run the function...</p>

<p><strong>Script One</strong></p>

<pre><code>$(""input#gform_submit_button_1"").on('click', function () {
    $contactSlide.stop().css(""top"",""0"");
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Script Two</strong></p>

<pre><code>$(""input#gform_submit_button_1"").click(function() {
    $contactSlide.stop().css(""top"",""0"");
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Script Three</strong></p>

<pre><code>$(""input#gform_submit_button_1"").focus(function () {
    $contactSlide.stop().css(""top"",""0"");
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Script Four</strong></p>

<pre><code>$(""form#gform_1"").submit(function(event) {
$contactSlide.stop().css(""top"",""0"");
});
</code></pre>

<p><br />
I've also tried...</p>

<pre><code>return false; 
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>return true;
</code></pre>

<p>on all of the scripts above, but none of them return the function. If I set the scripts to return false then the form does not submit, but if I set to return true, then form submits but the function does not run.</p>

<p><br />
Why is this happening, I thought this would be basic stuff?</p>

<p>Thanks for any help.</p>
